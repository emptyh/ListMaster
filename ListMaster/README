This app is going to allow for management of shopping lists and tasks list on the iPhone and iPad, while synchronizing with Evernote.  It will allow views for "list by store", "list by category", etc.  The hope is that the user, or the user significant other can enter things at home, on an iPhone or iPad, possibly even through a shared Evernote Notebook, and then the user can "check off" items in the store, these items will be updated real time. 

This app is open sourced.  Anyone interested in working on this application may do so by creating a fork.  Also since this app is in its initial creation phase, anyone interested in working with me on design or implementation, please contact me.  Please note this is a "hobby app" and not my real job so time devoted to this app will be sparse and updates may be sporadic.
